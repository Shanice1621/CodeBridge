<div class="about">
	<p>After her mother dies in a fire, Cassie Blake (Britt Robertson) goes to live with her grandmother in Chance Harbor, Wash. As she adjusts to her new life, she is more than skeptical when her new friends explain to her that she is a powerful witch and they have been waiting for her return so they can complete the Secret Circle. When she finds a spell book hidden in her mother's childhood bedroom, she realizes what they have told her is true, but there is more danger ahead for them than they realize.</p>
